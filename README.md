## Scripts

### With `exercism`: copy the default work directory to the local repo, the exercises resolved and commit to github

`bash exercism-upd.sh <language> <exercise-name>`

_Example: `bash exercism-upd.sh python grains`_

### Regenerate table to the README.md with statistics

`node scanExercises.js <source-of-exercises>`

_For example: `node scanExercises.js exercism`. In the folder `exercism` are include the `languages` and `exercises` folders with a directory structure similar to thisone:_

```
|--- exercism
|      |--- javascript
|      |      |--- anagram
|      |      |--- gigasecond
|      |      |--- hello-world
|      |      |--- ....
|      |--- python
|      |      |--- anagram
|      |      |--- gigasecond
|      |      |--- hello-world
|      |      |--- ....
```
